### What is the 'Dining Philosophers Prolem'? 

In Computer Science, the dining philosophers problem is an example often used in concurrent algorithm design to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques
for resolving them.


### Problems

- **Deadlock** each of the philosophers pick up a fork, no one can eat, hence, a deadlock.

- **Starvation** if a philosopher is not able to eat within the time limit, the philosopher may die.


### Possible Solutions

1. Resource Hierarchy Solution
2. Arbitrator Solution
3. Chandy/Misra Solution
